# README for Simple Multi Agent Experiments Repository

## Overview

Welcome to our repository dedicated to exploring the concept of control agents within autonomous environments. This project focuses on providing a straightforward and minimalist approach to experimenting with autonomous agents, emphasizing observation and simplicity in design. 

Our primary goal is to facilitate basic experimentation with autonomous agents by implementing a control agent that can autonomously generate, monitor, and equip multiple agents with tools for environmental simulations. This approach aims to foster a deeper understanding of autonomous agents' behaviors, decision-making processes, and capabilities when given the freedom to interact with their environment and each other.

## Features

- **Simple Control Agent Architecture:** A control agent capable of spawning and managing multiple sub-agents within a simulated environment.
- **Autonomous Agent Generation:** The ability for the control agent to dynamically create multiple agents, providing them with tools and objectives.
- **Observational Tools:** Facilities for observing and reporting on the actions, decisions, and outcomes of the autonomous agents within the simulation.
- **Flexible Experimentation:** Code that is designed to be easily modified and experimented upon, allowing for various outcomes based on slight adjustments to the agents' directives.
- **Educational Purpose:** A focus on understanding and observing the planning process, mindset, and behavior of autonomous agents at a basic level.

## Motivation

In the midst of complex codebases and sophisticated models, this project arises from the desire to strip back to the basics, offering a streamlined and accessible way to engage with the concept of autonomous agents. It serves as an entry point for those interested in experimenting with autonomy and environmental simulations without the overhead of complex systems. 

This repository stands as an alternative focus to mainstream advancements, aiming to provide insights into the capabilities and potential of simpler autonomous systems. It invites experimentation, modification, and public sharing of results, encouraging a community approach to understanding and advancing the field.

## Usage

This repository includes all the necessary code to get started with your autonomous agent experiments. It is designed to be user-friendly for both beginners and experienced programmers interested in the domain of autonomous agents and control systems.
